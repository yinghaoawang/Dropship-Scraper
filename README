# Updates and learning
Writing a crawler from scratch is pretty simple with NodeJS tools.
A major problem encoutered today was that Amazon's captcha was stopping my web scraper scraping!

Further research reveals that web scraping Amazon is not as easy as it seems.
Have decided that I should just sign up for Amazon affiliates, so I can use the product search API.
